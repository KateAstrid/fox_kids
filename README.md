Welcome to the most addictive game ever! You will want to catch the fox no matter what.

To start app type:
- npm install .
- npm start

The application consists of four screens:
- Welcome Screen
- Play Screen
- Scoreboard
- No Found 

I slightly changed the rules of the game:
- one point is deducted for each miss;
- one point is added for each success;
- as soon as the time runs out, the app goes to the Scoreboard Screen.

And I am in love with watercolor, so I used watercolor paintings instead of animals' photos.

When developing the application, I used Typescript + React Js, and Material UI as well.
Happy testing!
